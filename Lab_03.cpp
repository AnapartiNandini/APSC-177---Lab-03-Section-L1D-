* Brief Description: This program asks for user input for the number of trains on 4 		*
* train tracks. It sorts the tracks in descending order, giving precedence to the track 	*
* with the highest number of trains. If two tracks have the same number of input trains,	*
* the program follows the pre-determined priority order going from Track 4 to Track 1 		*
* where Track 4 has the highest priority.Based on the priority order, one train is 		*
* cleared to travel at a time and all other trains are stopped, on all tracks. The 		*
* information regarding how many trains are on each track, which track has cleared the  	*
* train, and how many trains are stopped on each track are displayed.				*
