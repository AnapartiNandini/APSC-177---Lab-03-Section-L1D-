UBC APSC 177 - Lab 03: Section L1D

This program asks for user input for the number of trains on 4 train tracks. It sorts the tracks in descending order, giving precedence to the track with the highest number of trains. If two tracks have the same number of input trains, the program follows the predetermined priority order going from Track 4 to Track 1 where Track 4 has the highest priority. Based on the priority order, one train is cleared to travel at a time and all other trains are stopped, on all tracks. The information regarding how many trains are on each track, which track has cleared the train, and how many trains are stopped on each track are displayed.
